### Hi there! 👋🏼

I'm a musician/software developer from Mexico, looking to get the best out of life.

#### Currently learning:
- ⚛️ Working on getting better with NextJS, React and Typescript.
- 🇲🇽🇺🇸🇮🇹🇫🇷 Trying to get the hang of Italian and French.
- 🪚 A little about woodwork every now and then.
- 🥐 How to perfect croissants, focaccia, bread in general. I love cooking but baking is not my brightest ability, so it's become my mission to master it at some point 👁.
